# Quick-Deferred-Acceptance-in-Python

Matches are women-indexed, i.e. are in the format (woman, man). Values are drawn randomly from the uniform distribution [0,1]. Women's values are a 2D array where [i,j] is woman i's value for man j; men's values are a 2d array where [i,j] is man i's value for woman j. 

The program demonstrates, for randomly generated values, statistics on (1) regular MPDA, (2) the group-optimal truncation, (3) the gains from group-optimal truncation (aka WPDA),  (4) the gains from an extra man in the market, and (5) the gains from the worst-off woman leaving the market. These can be made trivially analagous to real-world scenarios.
